**Hey you! Welcome to my Focus Projects Page!**
===============================================

This is a place for me to flex all my projects I do for my TKS Focus, which, by the way, is about Quantum Computing.
You can also read about the stuff I write on [Medium](https://max-c.medium.com)! 
And while you're here, why not apply to [TKS](https://tks.life)?
Anyways, enjoy the content and feel free to do a little exploring on your own!
Be **intentional** and **get sh\*t done!**

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TKSMax/Dilmof/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
