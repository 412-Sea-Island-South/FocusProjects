***ü¶à Hey you! Welcome to my Focus Projects Page!ü¶à***
=======================================================

This is a place for me to flex all my projects I do for my TKS Focus, which, by the way, is about Quantum Computing.
You can also read about the stuff I write on [Medium](https://max-c.medium.com)! 
And while you're here, why not apply to [TKS](https://tks.life)?
Anyways, enjoy the content and feel free to do a little exploring on your own! 

## About Me
Hello everybody, and welcome! I'm Max, a teenager and future unicorn ü¶Ñ person, also known as an innovator at [The Knowledge Society aka TKS](https://tks.world).
I'm interested in a lot of different emerging technologies, but my main interests right now are Quantum Computing ‚öõÔ∏è, Blockchain üíµ, Artificial Intelligence ü§ñ, and last but not least, Space Tech/Exploration üöÄ.
So yeah, that's basically who I am. You can check out my social media profiles below.

Introduction to Quantum Computing
---------------------------------

Ever wondered what quantum computing is? 
Or maybe you've never even heard of it before! 
Well, quantum computing is using quantum phenomena, such as *entanglement*, *superposition* and *teleportation* to perform computations.
The devices that perform quantum computations are no doubt called quantum computers.  
It's not too late to start learning!
Here are some courses you might want to check out:  
- [The Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-algorithms)
- [Quantum Conputing. Less Formulas More - Understanding](https://coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-lfmu)
- [Physical Basics of Quantum Computing](https://coursera.org/learn/physical-basis-quantum-computing)
- [EdX courses!](https://edx.org/learn/quantum-computing)

Project #1: Quantum Operations
------------------------------
### About the Project
In this project, I learned about the basic quantum operations that a quantum computer uses to perform quantum computations.
The quantum operations I will be introducing you to are for the IBM Quantum Experience, which is a cloud-based Quantum Computing service.
You can sign up for it [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com).

Project #2: Superdense Coding
-----------------------------
### About the Project
In this project, I explored the world of Quantum Cryptography, and learned about the Superdense Coding Protocol.
The SDC Protocol is a type of Quantum Cryptography, in which two classical bits of information are trabsmitted using one qubit.
This is like a flipped version of Quantum teleportation, which you can read about [here](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/teleportation.html).
Quantum Teleportation is the process of transmitting one qubit using two classical bits;
it's basically like destroying the quantum state of a qubit and recreating it elsewhere.
There are three steps to the Superdense Coding Protocol, which are
1. *Preparation*
2. *Encoding*
3. *Decoding*

Project #3: Grover's Algorithm
------------------------------
### About the Project
In this project, I learned about and recreated one of the most well-known Quantum Algorithms, namely **Grover's Algorithm**.
It was discovered by Lov Grover in 1996, twenty-five years ago.
This algorithm is a search algorithm, and it demonstrates the superior speed of a quantum computer in the task of searching through databases.
It provides a quadratic runtime improvement, which is what makes it so powerful.
It also serves as a Quantum Computing "hack" called the *Amplitude Amplification Trick*, which can be used to speed up many algorithms.
But that's not all!
You can also solve satisfiability problems (like the 2SAT and 3SAT), and even sudokus!
  
If you want to read more about Grover's Algorithm and how it works, [this article](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/grovers-algorithm-3ac4616ce23a) is a great place to begin!  
Or, you can view the project page [here](https://tksmax.github.io/Grovers-Algorithm)!  
Lastly, if you want to see some of the cool stuff Grover's Algorithm can do:

Enjoy!
