***Hey you! Welcome to my Focus Projects Page!***
===============================================

This is a place for me to flex all my projects I do for my TKS Focus, which, by the way, is about Quantum Computing.
You can also read about the stuff I write on [Medium](https://max-c.medium.com)! 
And while you're here, why not apply to [TKS](https://tks.life)?
Anyways, enjoy the content and feel free to do a little exploring on your own!

Introduction to Quantum Computing
---------------------------------

Ever wondered what quantum computing is? 
Or maybe you've never even heard of it before! 
Well, quantum computing is using quantum phenomena, such as *entanglement*, *superposition* and *teleportation* to perform computations.
The devices that perform quantum computations are no doubt called quantum computers. 
It's not too late to start learning!
Here are some courses you might want to check out!
*Some courses may cost money*

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TKSMax/Dilmof/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
